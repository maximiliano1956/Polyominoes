# polyminoes

This is a program that i wrote long ago.
polymin try to fill a shape with a set of polyominoes.
The definition of the set of pieces and the fields to fill are in the polymin.dat file and is self-explanatory.
The solutions are saved in the solution folder and you can choose among three possibile format : ASCII,XPM,JPEG.
It's possibile to activate a check to find some simmetry in the solutions.
It's also possibile to save a snapshot of the search and then reload it to continue later.
The program run on Linux. To compile run "make"
To compile correctly you have to install the libraries:
